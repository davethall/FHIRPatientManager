FHIR Patient Manager Class Project Dave Thall

This was built using Replit Agent on Replit

Write a java script to build webpage that queries a FHIR server, 
that queries a FHIR server, displaying their patient names, gender and date of birth.
create patients by submitting a form with the patients name, gender, date of birth and phone number.  
Proper validation needs to be done on all fields. Allow updates of all patients who are on the FHIR server
by opening them on the same webpage and updating details. Search patients by their name or phone number.

To build a webpage that interacts with a FHIR server for querying and updating patient data, we'll use JavaScript 
(along with HTML and CSS for structure and styling). 

The following example will:

Query the FHIR server for patient data.
Display patient names, gender, and birth date.
Allow patient creation with a form (validating inputs).
Search patients by name or phone number.
Enable patient updates.
