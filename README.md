App Name: 
FHIR Patient Manager Class Project Dave Thall

This was built using Replit Agent on Replit

Requirements: 

Write a java script to build webpage that queries a FHIR server, 
that queries a FHIR server, displaying their patient names, gender and date of birth.
create patients by submitting a form with the patients name, gender, date of birth and phone number.  
Proper validation needs to be done on all fields. Allow updates of all patients who are on the FHIR server
by opening them on the same webpage and updating details. Search patients by their name or phone number.

To build a webpage that interacts with a FHIR server for querying and updating patient data.

The following example will:

Query the FHIR server for patient data.
Display patient names, gender, and birth date.
Allow patient creation with a form (validating inputs).
Search patients by name or phone number.
Enable patient updates.

Details:

I'm planning to enroll into an AI class next year and have been using different AI tools to get a better
understanding in applying it to an architect level. Focusing on image processing. When asking Chat GPT 
the same question. Some of the java script worked but did not allow patient edits, and errors.
 
I built the app first in javascript and jumped to Replit using their Agent.

This was built using Replit Agent on Replit:
Asking the following question.

Write a java script to build a web page that queries a FHIR server, that queries a FHIR server, displaying their patient names, 
gender and date of birth. create patients by submitting a form with the patient's name, gender, date of birth and phone number. 
Proper validation needs to be done on all fields. Allow updates of all patients who are on the FHIR server by opening them on 
the same webpage and updating details. Search patients by their name or phone number.

To build a webpage that interacts with a FHIR server for querying and updating patient data. 
We'll use JavaScript (along with HTML and CSS for structure and styling).

The following example will:

Query the FHIR server for patient data.
Display patient names, gender, and birth date.
Allow patient creation with a form (validating inputs).
Search patients by name or phone number. Enable patient updates.

It replied back in writing the following.

Written in javascript:
main.js

Written in python:
app.py
main.py

Written in html:
base.html
index.html

Written in css:
custom.css

Installed flask, flask-sqlalchemy, ect..
Configured flask to run python

FHIR URL used: http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4

It tried to install a fhir client. which caused errors and requested AI to rollback the logic and uninstall the fhir client. 
I requested AI to only use direct API calls for all interactions with the FHIR server. 
This change was applied to both the frontend javascript code and the backend Flash applications.  

Screens print are attached:
testing:
1- from replit URL when in development
2- tested using a iphone
